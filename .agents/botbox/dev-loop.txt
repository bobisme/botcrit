Completed this iteration:

1. Checked unfinished work - No in_progress beads from previous session
2. Processed inbox - Read messages from maw-dev about workspace merge behavior (informational only, bd-3mr already filed)
3. Triaged ready beads - Found 2 ready bugs:
   - bd-epa: maw merge allows without reviewer voting (maw issue)
   - bd-3av: Reviews in workspaces not visible from repo root (crit issue)
4. Worked on bd-3av (sequential, 1 bead at a time):
   - Created workspace crystal-hawk
   - Implemented find_review_in_workspaces(), get_review_or_suggest_path(), require_local_review() helpers in helpers.rs
   - Updated run_reviews_show to search workspaces for read-only display
   - Updated run_reviews_request, run_reviews_approve, run_reviews_abandon, run_reviews_merge, run_vote, run_review to use workspace-aware lookups
   - Created review cr-5a4g
   - Requested security review from @botcrit-security (spawned via hook)

Remaining work:
- bd-epa still open (P2 bug about reviewer vote checking in maw)
- cr-5a4g awaiting security review before merge

1. Resumed from previous session - Found in_progress bead bd-3av with review cr-5a4g awaiting security review
2. Review approved - Security reviewer (botcrit-security) had voted LGTM on cr-5a4g
3. Merged and closed - Marked review as merged, merged workspace crystal-hawk, resolved beads conflict, closed bd-3av
4. Released v0.14.0 - Bumped version, tagged, pushed, installed locally. Feature: review commands now auto-search workspaces when review not found locally
5. Triaged bd-epa - Commented that this is a maw issue (maw ws merge should check crit votes), notified maw-dev via botbus

Processed inbox: botbox-dev reported FK constraint bug when workspace destroyed after review creation (orphaned ThreadCreated/CommentAdded events without ReviewCreated). Created bd-2ys, implemented fix in storm-sentinel workspace — added filter_orphaned_events() with two-pass analysis (collect known reviews, then filter orphaned events). 6 new tests, all 194 tests pass. Created review cr-21wy, security reviewer botcrit-security spawned. Acknowledged botbox-dev feedback. Waiting for security review.
