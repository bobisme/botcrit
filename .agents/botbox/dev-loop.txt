[1mTriage[0m: Processed 4 inbox messages (security reviewer signoffs, P1 bug report from botbox-dev). Found 2 ready beads: bd-2qa (P1 bug: inbox --all-workspaces false orphan detection) and bd-2zd (integration test for same bug).

[1mWork done[0m: Fixed bd-2qa in workspace calm-phoenix:
- [1mRoot cause[0m: [36minbox --all-workspaces[0m synced each workspace independently. When ReviewCreated lived in workspace's [36m.crit/[0m but ReviewersRequested lived in root's [36m.crit/[0m, orphan detection classified the root events as orphaned → empty inbox → reviewer exits immediately.
- [1mFix[0m: Rewrote the all-workspaces path to merge ALL events from ALL workspaces into a single in-memory projection before querying inbox. Orphan detection now sees the complete picture. Also added [36mrebuild_from_events()[0m, made [36mopen_in_memory()[0m public, and added [36mextra_known_reviews[0m parameter to [36mfilter_orphaned_events()[0m.
- [1mTests[0m: Added 4 new tests (199 total, all passing): cross-workspace orphan prevention, real-orphan filtering, cross-workspace rebuild, and merged-events inbox verification.
- Closed bd-2zd (integration test bead) as tests included in the fix.

[1mReview[0m: Created cr-kex3, requested security review from @botcrit-security (reviewer spawned).
