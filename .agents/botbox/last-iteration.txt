Processed Bob's bug report: crit inbox --all-workspaces was showing reviews after voting due to stale workspace projections. Root cause: each workspace has its own events.jsonl snapshot, and stale workspaces missing vote/merge events produced false positives in the combined inbox.

Created bd-1nf, implemented fix in workspace amber-panther:
- Added [36mget_voted_reviews()[0m and [36mget_terminal_reviews()[0m query helpers to ProjectionDb (query.rs)
- Modified [36m--all-workspaces[0m inbox path in reviews.rs to collect exclusion sets across ALL workspaces, then post-filter combined results
- Added 2 new tests (185/185 pass)
- Created review cr-v486, requested security review from @botcrit-security (spawned via hook)

Awaiting security re-review on cr-v486 before merge.
