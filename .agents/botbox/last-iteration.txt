Inbox: Processed security review feedback on cr-1s0w (bd-2r8) — 3 findings (HIGH path traversal, MEDIUM dedup collision, LOW info disclosure). Also found cr-5tjx (bd-339) had been approved.

Beads completed:
- bd-339 (.critignore): cr-5tjx approved by botcrit-security, marked merged, bead closed.

Beads worked:
- bd-2r8 (migration fix): Addressed all 3 security findings in workspace shadow-reef — added is_review_id() validation, improved dedup keys, sanitized eprintln output. Added regression test. Re-requested security review on cr-1s0w.

Status: bd-2r8 awaiting security re-review on cr-1s0w. No other ready beads.
