Completed one dev cycle for bd-o3f: Auto-approve review when LGTM vote received (unless blocked by others). Implemented has_blocking_votes_from_others() query method and modified run_vote() to auto-approve when LGTM and no blocks from other reviewers. Added 6 tests, all 131 tests pass. Created review cr-fm38 in workspace electric-tiger. Remaining ready beads: bd-2m6 (P1 bug - events.jsonl truncation), bd-1lk (P2 - review_reviewers projection), bd-3is (P3 - adopt terseid). Stopping to await reviewer feedback on cr-fm38.
