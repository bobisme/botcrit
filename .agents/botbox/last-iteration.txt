Checked review status for cr-5tjx (bd-339 .critignore support). Review still open with no votes - security reviewer not yet active. Re-sent @botcrit-security mention to trigger reviewer spawn. Only one bead (bd-339) exists and it's awaiting review. No other work available. Awaiting security LGTM on cr-5tjx before merge.
