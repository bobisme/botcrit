Fix: conditional hunk_old_end computation. 6 new tests added."}}

The fix correctly handles old_count=0 pure-addition hunks using saturating_sub for safe u32 arithmetic. No injection vectors, no path traversal, no unbounded resource consumption. Integer overflow is not practical since values come from jj diff output bounded by file sizes."}}
