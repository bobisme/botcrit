No security issues found.\n\n**Checked:**\n- SQL injection: All operations use parameterized queries (params![]) — safe\n- Duplicate event handling: All event handlers use INSERT OR IGNORE or ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE — safe against duplicate events from merged workspaces\n- Path traversal: validate_review_id() validates review IDs; workspace paths from trusted jj source\n- Memory safety: In-memory DB is scoped to function call, no persistent state leaks\n- Error handling: Silent error swallowing in workspace reads matches prior pattern, not exploitable\n- Transaction safety: unchecked_transaction on single-threaded in-memory DB is correct\n\n**Notes (non-blocking):**\n- sync_from_review_logs_with_known() is pub but unused — consider removing dead code\n- Good test coverage with 4 new cross-workspace scenarios"}}
