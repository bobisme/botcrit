SQL injection: Uses parameterized queries consistently\n2. Schema constraints: CHECK constraints prevent invalid status values\n3. Logic: effective_status derivation is correct - thread resolved if t.status='resolved' OR r.status IN ('merged','abandoned')\n4. No auth/access control changes\n5. No sensitive data exposure\n\nTests pass (176 total, 3 new for this feature)."}}
