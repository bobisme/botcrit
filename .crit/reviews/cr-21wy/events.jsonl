No security concerns: (1) All data is from local filesystem (trusted boundary), (2) no SQL injection (uses existing parameterized queries), (3) no information disclosure in warnings (only internal review IDs), (4) no unbounded resource usage, (5) all Event variants properly covered in match arms, (6) sentinel values properly scoped to internal HashSet. Clean defensive improvement."}}
