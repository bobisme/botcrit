Adds 4 tests covering exact match, within-range, outside-range, and resolved-thread cases."}}

SQL query uses parameterized params (no injection risk). COALESCE handles NULL selection_end correctly for single-line fallback. Input is u32→i64 cast (safe range). Test coverage is thorough with boundary cases."}}
